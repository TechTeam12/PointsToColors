# PointsToColors - BackEnd
The goal of this project is to be an extension for Twitch for streamers. The extension will allow you to use your points to control your Phillip Hues lights. 

This portion of the application is the "BackEnd" portion. It is responsible for interacting with the Phillip Hues light bulbs.
