# PointsToColors
The goal of this project is to be an extension for Twitch for streamers. The extension will allow you to use your points to control your Phillip Hues lights. 

There will be a web application portion of this as well. (Front end interface for streamers, and back end integration to phillip hues).
This piece of the tooling is the extension for the Twitch side. 

This application will be free for use while developing, and while I can afford it. After which point it is still open to everyone to host on their own.
